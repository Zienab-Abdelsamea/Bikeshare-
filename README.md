Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree Project  Professional track- investigate-tmdb-dataset 

# Project Overview:
In this project, you'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. Later Nanodegree projects will focus on individual pieces of the data analysis process.

You'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

## Objectives:

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process.
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions.
- Investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format that can be used
- Communicating the results of your analysis

## Technologies Used
* Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook
